folders should be project name (i.e. whalen, seagrass)
first create the solution in visual studio. I will put my additional folder within this.

each project should have a spatial folder - move seagrass shapefiles in that you need. This will be repetitive, but it seems safer than always referencing the data in the root.

then have a folder for each run
then for each run folder have folders for mxd, output, and output/shp

folder and runs should be names with project name and date e.g. seagrass_20190422 (well not always)

copy scripts in from scripts_tools or other projects
