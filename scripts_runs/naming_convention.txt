folders should be project name (i.e. whalen, seagrass)
each project should have folders for outputs, mxd, spatial, etc.
spatial folder should only be used for specialized spatial data. Otherwise try to keep data in the root spatial folder.

make a solution for each project that can hold multiple runs
copy tool scripts in that you need

runs should be named descriptive enough. Will figure out convention as I go.
