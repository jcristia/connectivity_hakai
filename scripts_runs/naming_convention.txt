folders should be project name (i.e. whalen, seagrass)
each project should have folders for outputs, mxd, spatial, etc.
for spatial folder - move seagrass shapefiles in that you need. This will be repetitive, but it seems safer than always referencing the data in the root.

make a solution for each project that can hold multiple runs
within a solution have a folder for each run (create within visual studio)

folder and runs should be names with project name and date e.g. seagrass_20190422
