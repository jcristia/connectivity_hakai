folders should be project name (i.e. whalen, seagrass)
each project should have folders for outputs, mxd, spatial, etc.
for spatial folder - try moving shapefiles in that you need. This will be repetitive, but it seems safer than always referencing the data in the root.

make a solution for each project that can hold multiple runs
copy tool scripts in that you need

runs should be named descriptive enough. Will figure out convention as I go.
